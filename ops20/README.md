### **Deployment**

>**What's Here?** Deploying the demo environment on Azure - including manual steps to perform after the automation is finished

[Instructions and prerequisites are outlined here](deployment/README.md). 

A "Deploy to Azure" button streamlines the process, but make sure you have created an account on Azure and generated a Service Principal ID and password before you press it.
