# Prerequisites

## Azure Subscription

If you are presenting the demonstrations live you will need to access the Azure Portal, which requires an Azure account. If you have not done so already, [sign up for free here](https://portal.azure.com).

## Azure Devops

You will also be demonstrating functionality with Azure Boards (part of Azure Devops). You can [sign up for an account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

## Microsoft Teams

You will also be demonstrating functionality from within Microsoft Teams. If you do not have an account, [sign up for one here](https://teams.microsoft.com/start).

## Postman

To send an alert to the Logic App used in Demo 1, requires sending a JSON payload to a URL. This is accomplished easily using the Postman tool.[ Windows and Mac versions are both avaiable](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).

This or similar tool is recommended for the first demonstration.
