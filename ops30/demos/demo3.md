# OPS 30 Demo 3 Script - Querying the activity log via log analytics

## Demo from Video

We are currently recommending all OPS30 demos on stage be done from recorded videos as we work to strip down the requirements necessary to give a live demo from your own deployment. A recording of this demo suitable for presentation is embedded in the [slide deck](../presentations.md).

## Demo talk track/script

We are working on providing a good transcript for the intended talk track for this demo. In the meantime, please see the voiceover from the explanation video of this demo [here](https://globaleventcdn.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ops/ops30/video/OPS30_Demo3.mp4).
