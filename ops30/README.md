# OPS30 Learning From Failure - Train the trainer

## Session Abstract

Incidents will happen—there’s no doubt about that. The key question is whether you will treat them as a learning opportunity to make your operations practice better or just as a loss of time, money, and reputation.  

In this session, you’ll dive into one of the most important topics for improving reliability: how to learn from failure. We’ll listen in on one of Tailwind Traders post-incident reviews, often called a postmortem so we can see how it is done. You’ll learn how to shape and run this process so it actually yields value from something that would ordinarily be just a failure. After this session, you’ll be able to build a key feedback loop in your organization that turns unplanned outages into opportunities

### **Deployment**

>**What's Here?** Deploying the demo environment on Azure - including manual steps to perform after the automation is finished

[Instructions and prerequisites are outlined here](deployment/README.md). 

A "Deploy to Azure" button streamlines the process, but make sure you have created an account on Azure and generated a Service Principal ID and password before you press it.

### **Demos**

>**What's Here?** Pre-delivery preparation, stage ready videos, required files (such as JSON templates), and walk-through videos

Detailed explanations of each demonstration associated with this presentation can be found in this section. There are 3 "live from stage" technical demonstrations that utilize a number of tools both in and out of Azure. [You can get a high level overview of the tools and how we will be using them here](tools/README.md).
