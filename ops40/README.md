# OPS40 - Deployment Practices for Greater Reliability

## Session Abstract

Infrastructure and software delivery methods have a direct and material impact on reliability. Manual service deployment and provisioning is slow, error-prone, and can result in incidents. Using modern continuous deployment practices and provisioning methods can reduce overhead while preventing incidents before they happen.

In this session, we will see how continuous delivery pipelines have helped Tailwind Traders and the rest of the industry deploy tested software to production environments to increase reliability. Weâ€™ll also explore modern methods for environment provisioning using infrastructure as code. As a result of attending this session, you will gain practical information on automated deployment and provisioning solutions using Azure-based technology.
